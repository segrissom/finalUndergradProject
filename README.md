# finalProject
Yo so this is the code of my final project for a class, I really haven't gotten around to checking to see that any of it is working, mostly because I don't have the database saved on my laptop because there's a ton of it and I would rather have that on my school's system than my laptop's. However, I am also incredibly lazy and the four minute walk to campus to work on this code is too much, plus I really like the couch in my apartment. But I put this on github because I can never remember where my flashdrives are and github lets me work on any computer and keep things updated and relatively current, you know, bro? 
But anyways, for those interested, this is all to write a current map of the stars in the sky that will be eventually turned in to a gui in matlab because the course is a matlab course and I apparently hate myself. But really the code that is currently up here is to do with just getting the time right in order to even be able to pull up the correct stars so like this stuff is pretty boring so far.
